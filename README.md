Gnocco is a DNS cache with resolver, it is based on the wonderful DNS library from Miek Gieben
[dns](https://github.com/miekg/dns) and it is heavily inspired from the DNS cache implemented 
by Qiang Ke [godns](https://github.com/kenshinx/godns).
The resolving part will be a correct resolver using a resolving algorithm similar with the one implemented
in [dnscache](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dnscache.html).

Gnocco is in very early stages of development with most of its features not implemented yet.
